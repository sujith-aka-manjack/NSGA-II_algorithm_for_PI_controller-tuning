# NSGA-II_algorithm_for_PI_controller-tuning

Using NSGA-II algorithm to determine ideal the Proportional and Integral values for a PI controller to achieve the required performance criterias. Sobelset is used to generate 100 sets of sample space. NSGA-II algorithm is performed for 250 iterations or till a convergence occurs. Half of the best solutions is carried over to the next iteration.
